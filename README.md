# Important Information
# Process
* Use “Improvement” or “New Feature” for feedback on design/user experience that isn’t an outright bug. Need to present defensible reasoning since we don’t have time/bandwidth for a two way discussion. Don’t be lazy.
* Screenshots on bugs are really appreciated, circle in red.
* If there isn’t a good id for an element, submit a bug like this
Preface the bug “Needs ID:”
*Only one business partner is technical, know that reporting your bugs/suggestions.
# Product
* No formal plans right now for contested rentals (damaged goods, no returns, etc.)
* Messages are not hooked up until next week
* We will have somewhat of an api/testing environment next week as well
* This is a ported Airbnb clone, so some system generated text might be skewed that way, note those.
* Also, some systems haven’t been tested since the clone was purchased.
